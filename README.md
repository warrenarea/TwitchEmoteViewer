```

Place "Twitch Emote Viewer" files in a folder with your emotes,
or in a folder in proximity to your emotes. 

If you don't post the files in your current folder, you may need to 
manually indicate what folders your emotes are in. 

Then press "Browse..." and click on the emote you want to view.

Press Ctrl, and Mouse scroll wheel to scale in browser.
